                            Just desserts started out as a humble cupcakery in 2019 and has since grown into a household name, with over 12 outlets islandwide. 
                            Baked fresh daily, our cupcakes come in a variety of delectable flavours with new creations added regularly to our menu.  
                            Besides the awesome cupcakes, our versatile team also dreams up favorite bakes with delectable cookies as well. 
                            The chunky chewy cookies come in a plethora of flavours. All our desserts are MUIS Halal certified.
